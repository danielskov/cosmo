        <p>
            Cosmogenic nuclides are typically used to either constrain an
            exposure age, a burial age, or an erosion rate. Constraining the
            landscape history and past erosion rates in previously glaciated
            terrains is, however, notoriously difficult because it involves a
            large number of unknowns. The potential use of cosmogenic nuclides
            in landscapes with a complex history of exposure and erosion is
            therefore often quite limited. Here, we present a novel
            multi-nuclide approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
            technique.  The model framework currently incorporates any
            combination of the following nuclides <sup>10</sup>Be,
            <sup>26</sup>Al, <sup>14</sup>C, and <sup>21</sup>Ne, and is highly
            flexible.
