                    Cosmogenic nuclides are typically used to either constrain
                    an exposure age, a burial age, or an erosion rate.
                    Constraining the landscape history and past erosion rates in
                    previously glaciated terrains is, however, notoriously
                    difficult because it involves a large number of unknowns.
                    This tool uses an approach based on the Markov Chain Monte
                    Carlo (MCMC) technique.  The model framework currently
                    incorporates any combination of the following terrestrial
                    cosmogenic nuclides (TCNs) <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al,
                    <sup>14</sup>C, and <sup>21</sup>Ne in order to constrain a
                    two-stage glacial/interglacial history at the site of
                    sampling.</p>

                    <p>The MCMC technique is used to simulate TCN concentrations
                    associated with a large number of different
                    glacial-interglacial histories, including highly varying
                    glacial and interglacial erosion rates. Based on comparisons
                    to measured concentrations, it is possible to determine the
                    most likely landscape history and associated uncertainties.

                        Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) basics</h3>
                    <p>The inversion problem of turning observed TCN
                    concentrations into erosion histories is handled using a
                    conventional Metropolis-Hastings MCMC approach. The
                    model parameters are constrained between fixed model
                    parameter bounds specified by the user. Erosion rates
                    (&epsilon;<sub>int</sub>, &epsilon;<sub>gla</sub>), which
                    may vary over several orders of magnitude, are tested
                    with uniform probability across the logarithmic parameter
                    interval. The temporal parameter (<i>t</i><sub>degla</sub>)
                    and climate record threshold value
                    (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>threshold</sub>) are tested with
                    uniform probability across the linear parameter interval.
                    </p>

                    <p>When model parameters 
                    (&epsilon;<sub>int</sub>, &epsilon;<sub>gla</sub>,
                    <i>t</i><sub>degla</sub>,
                    &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>threshold</sub>) are varied within
                    specified limits, they can be thought of as being orthogonal
                    axes spanning a coordinate system in four-dimensional space.
                    Each position in this model space is associated with a
                    unique set of model parameter values.
                    </p>

                    <p>Given a single value of model parameters
                    (&epsilon;<sub>int</sub>, &epsilon;<sub>gla</sub>,
                    <i>t</i><sub>degla</sub>,
                    &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>threshold</sub>) within the
                    specified limits, the TCN concentration after the duration
                    of e.g. the entire Quaternary period in a sample can be
                    computed. This <i>forward model</i> describes a possible
                    history of exhumation and TCN production in a sample volume
                    as it experiences the variable physical environment of the
                    Quaternary.</p>


                    <div id="twostage" class="subsection scrollspy">

                            Two-stage glacial-interglacial forward model</h4>
                        <p>The forward model builds on the assumption of
                        "two-stage uniformitarianism", meaning that the
                        processes that operated during the Holocene also
                        operated during earlier interglacials with comparable
                        intensity. Likewise, the erosion rate during the past
                        glacial periods is assumed to be comparable.</p>

                        <p>The model approach assumes that glacial periods were
                        characterized by 100% shielding and no exposure, which
                        would require more than 10 m of ice thickness for
                        production due to spallation (&gt;50 m for muons).
                        Interglacial periods are assumed to have been
                        characterized by 100% exposure and zero shielding. The
                        production of TCNs takes place during the interglacials,
                        while erosion removes the land surface at different
                        rates during the glacials and interglacials.</p>

                        <p>The forward model switches between glacial and
                        interglacial state when the selected climate record
                        crosses a threshold value. The provided climate records
                        are based on a benthic &delta;<sup>18</sub>O record,
                        smoothed by various degrees, implying that climate
                        at the site of sample is correlated to the global
                        state.</p>

                    <div id="mcmcwalker" class="subsection scrollspy">

                            What is a MCMC walker?</h4>
                        <p>
                        A MCMC walker is in this context a numerical entity
                        which sequentially explores the model parameter space in
                        order to obtain the closest match between the forward
                        model and the observational dataset of TCNs. During each
                        iteration the walker takes its current position in model
                        space, plugs the parameter value into the forward model,
                        and evaluates if the output result matches the
                        observational record better or worse than the output at
                        its previous position in model space. If the new results
                        better matches the observed dataset, it continues
                        walking in the same direction in model space.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Starting at a random place inside the model space, a
                        burn-in phase of 1000 iterations is first used to make a
                        crude search of the entire model space.  The burn-in
                        phase is followed by a similar but more detailed and
                        local search of the model space, based on the best-fit
                        model parameters from the burn-in phase.  The weighted
                        least-squared misfit to observed TCN concentrations is
                        used to evaluate the likelyhood for the combinations of
                        model parameter values.  The MCMC walker continues
                        exploring the model space until it is sufficiently
                        satisfied with the best model parameter estimate it has
                        found.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        For a given observational data set more than one set of
                        model parameters may produce forward models which
                        sufficiently satisfy the MCMC walker.  In this case the
                        solution is <i>non-unique</i>. Even worse, a single MCMC
                        walker may find an area in model space which seemingly
                        is in good correspondence with the observational data
                        set, but the walker is missing a much better set of
                        model parameters since they are located somewhere
                        entirely different in the model space. In order to
                        mitigate these issues, MCMC inversions are often
                        performed using several MCMC walkers.  The starting
                        point of each MCMC walker is chosen at random, resulting
                        in unique walks through the model space. If a single
                        walker is caught in an area of non-ideal solutions,
                        chances are that the other walkers will find the area of
                        better model parameters.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The computational time depends on the number of MCMC
                        walkers. When casually trying out the calculator we
                        recommend using low numbers of MCMC walkers (1 to 2) in
                        order to obtain fast results and reduce load on the
                        server.  When attempting to produce high-quality and
                        reliable results, the number of walkers should be
                        increased (3 to 4).
