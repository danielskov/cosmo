                    Cosmogenic nuclides are typically used to either constrain
                    an exposure age, a burial age, or an erosion rate.
                    Constraining the landscape history and past erosion rates in
                    previously glaciated terrains is, however, notoriously
                    difficult because it involves a large number of unknowns.
                    This webpage uses an approach based on the Markov Chain
                    Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique.  The model framework currently
                    incorporates any combination of the following terrestrial
                    cosmogenic nuclides (TCNs) <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al,
                    <sup>14</sup>C, and <sup>21</sup>Ne in order to constrain a
                    two-stage glacial/interglacial history at the site of
                    sampling.</p>

                    <p>The MCMC technique is used to simulate TCN concentrations
                    associated with a large number of different
                    glacial-interglacial histories, including highly varying
                    glacial and interglacial erosion rates. Based on comparisons
                    to measured concentrations, it is possible to determine the
                    most likely landscape history and associated uncertainties.

                        last deglaciation (<i>t</i><sub>degla</sub>), and the
                        climate threshold value in the marine oxygen-isotope
                        record (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>threshold</sub>) at

                    <p>The inversion problem of turning observed TCN
                    concentrations into erosion histories is handled using a
                    conventional Metropolis-Hastings MCMC approach where the
                    model parameters are constrained between fixed model
                    parameter bounds specified by the user. Erosion rates
                    (&epsilon;<sub>int</sub>, &epsilon;<sub>gla</sub>), which
                    may vary over several orders of magnitude, are specified
                    with uniform probability across the logarithmic parameter
                    interval. The temporal parameter (<i>t</i><sub>degla</sub>)
                    and climate record threshold value
                    (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>threshold</sub>) is specified
                    with uniform probability across the linear
                    parameter interval. The user specifies the bounds
                    of the model parameters, which define the model space.

                    forward responses are computed based on an initial set of
                    model parameters that is proposed using the
                    Metropolis-Hastings technique. A burn-in phase of 1000
                    iterations is first used to make a crude initial search of
                    the model space. This step is followed by a more detailed
                    and local search of the model space based on the best-fit
                    model parameters from the burn-in phase.

                        Two-stage glacial-interglacial model</h3>
                    <p>The model concept builds on the assumption of a
                    "two-stage uniformitarianism", meaning that the processes
                    that operated during the Holocene also operated during
                    earlier interglacials with comparable intensity. Likewise,
                    the erosion rate during the past glacial periods is assumed
                    to be comparable.</p>

                    <p>The model approach assumes that glacial periods were
                    characterized by 100% shielding and no exposure, which would
                    require more than 10 m of ice thickness for production due
                    to spallation (&gt;50 m for muons). Interglacial periods are
                    assumed to have been characterized by 100% exposure and zero
                    shielding.</p>
