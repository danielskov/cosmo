<p class="flow-text">
Cosmogenic nuclides are typically used to either constrain an exposure age, a
burial age, or an erosion rate. Constraining the landscape history and past
erosion rates in previously glaciated terrains is, however, notoriously
difficult because it involves a large number of unknowns. The potential use of
cosmogenic nuclides in landscapes with a complex history of exposure and
erosion is therefore often quite limited. Here, we present a novel
multi-nuclide approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique.
The model framework currently incorporates any combination of the following
nuclides <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al, <sup>14</sup>C, and <sup>21</sup>Ne,
and is highly flexible.
